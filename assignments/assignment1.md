# Assignment 1

## Domains. 

Ten domains I am interested in:

1. research
2. AI
3. finance & investing
4. traveling
5. board games & poker
6. health and longevity
7. books
8. politics
9. sports
10. photography

A few sentences explaining my interest in the three above:
- Research – finding better ways to collaborate and communicate with other researchers. Making research more liquid by lowering barriers to contributing, discussing, and accessing work, so that sharing happens more freely and ideas circulate more widely.
- Finance & Investing – developing better ways to manage personal finances without sacrificing privacy. Making investment and trading strategies more accessible and easier to implement in a personal setting.
- Books – discovering new books to read and keeping track of what you have already read. I'm interested in better ways to share recommendations, reviews, discussions, surface hidden gems, and make reading more engaging and social.

## Problems. 

### Research

1. Very few ways to engage in paper discussion.
2. High friction in peer reviewing.
3. Lack of awareness of others' work in the same domain.

### Finance & investing

1. Monopolies that sell private data.
2. High friction and cost of accessing trading data.
3. Inability to apply financial instruments to make better predictions.

### Books

1. Hard to keep track of what I've read, what I want to read, and my reviews/notes on books I've finished.
2. Difficult to judge reviews/ratings from anonymous people across many different platforms (Google, Kindle, Goodreads).
3. No good way to join discussions around the same book, since many platforms exist and there is no widely preferred one.

### Selected problems

#### **Very few ways to engage in paper discussion.**

Paper discussions are happening on such different levels and random platforms that it is hard to find and join discussions about a given paper. Many people in the same lab might be dumping papers in the Slack channel (usually called `#paper-dump` or similar), where sometimes a discussion happens in the thread related to this paper. Many discussions occur on X (Twitter), but follow a more informal style and are usually hype-based, spotlighting only top trending papers. Some discussions happen under numerous YT videos that explain paper, but they are also hard to find and are spread across many different (but usually similar in content) videos.

#### **High friction and cost of accessing trading data.**

Many people would like to approach investing more methodologically, doing something more sophisticated than following general trends or copying politicians' investments. However, this usually requires getting and processing raw data from the exchange of choice. Because of the high variety of exchanges and large amounts of data, it is usually a very tedious and costly process that stops people from investing in a "home" setting.

#### **Difficult to judge reviews/ratings from anonymous people across many different platforms (Google, Kindle, Goodreads).**

Ratings for the same book can vary a lot across different platforms. This is sometimes explained by small sample sizes, but more because of specific preferences. If people could understand what kind of person (in terms of their book taste) gave a 5 or 2 star review, it might change their decision to read a book.


### Unselected problems

#### **Lack of awareness of others' work in the same domain.**

This is an essential part of research that has become much easier to do in recent years with the help of AI (e.g. GPT research/browse mode, Perplexity, etc) and higher engagement from the research community on the internet. It is not usually time-consuming, and researchers typically follow new papers and ideas in their field on a constant basis anyway.

#### **Inability to apply financial instruments to make better predictions.**

That is largely a user skill issue, which can be solved by learning from the numerous sources available on the Internet. A problem "it is hard to do well in X because I have never done X before" is not really a problem, but more of natural expectation. X in this case is "investment".

#### **Hard to keep track of what I've read, what I want to read, and my reviews/notes on books I've finished.**

Not as widespread or pressing a problem as the other two.

## Stakeholders. 

### Research
1. **Researchers** – primary contributors and consumers of academic work. They are most directly affected because limited discussion reduces feedback, collaboration, and visibility for their papers.  A discussion platform could make finding errors and new ideas much easier and more frequent.

2. **Audience familiar with the topic** – students or early-career researchers who want to learn from and engage with the material. They lose opportunities to ask questions, learn deeper insights, or clarify misunderstandings.

3. **General audience** – curious readers outside the field (e.g., industry professionals, hobbyists). They are often excluded from meaningful discussions, even if they could bring useful perspectives.

### Finance & Investing
1. **People willing to get into investing** – newcomers are usually discouraged because data is expensive or hard to process, which keeps investing inaccessible. On top of that, more knowledgeable traders mean more competition, which reduces profit.

2. **Traders** – both retail and professional traders face increased costs and wasted time due to poor access to data, which reduces efficiency and innovation. However, they may also benefit from better understanding all the exchange pitfalls, having an edge over newcomers.

3. **Exchanges** – they act as gatekeepers of data. While they benefit financially from selling it, they also risk alienating potential users and limiting overall market volume and liquidity.

### Books
1. **Readers** – they rely on reviews to decide what to read, but inconsistent or untrustworthy ratings lead to poor choices and wasted time and money.

2. **Authors** – their reputation and sales depend on reviews. Inaccurate or unrepresentative ratings can hurt visibility or distort perception of their work.

3. **Publishers** – they use reviews to market and promote books. The review system is a key promotional channel for them as well.

## Evidence. 

### 1. Research — Very few ways to engage in paper discussion

My main evidence is my personal experience and my researcher friends' experiences. However, this problem is acknowledged, which can be seen by many discussions on reddit and forums about common ways to engage in paper discussions. More sources are below:

- [Academia StackExchange: Is there a good site for holding online discussions of scientific papers?](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/2385/is-there-a-good-site-for-holding-online-discussions-of-scientific-papers) — Multiple users note there is no centralized, widely adopted platform.

## Features. 

### 1. Research — Very few ways to engage in paper discussion

#### Discussion Pubs (per DOI/arXiv ID)
Automatically create a canonical discussion space for each paper keyed by DOI or arXiv ID. This makes conversations easy to find and avoids fragmentation across Slack, X, and YouTube. Helps researchers, students, and the general audience converge in one place.

#### Author & Affiliation Badges (ORCID-verified)
Let authors verify via ORCID or institutional email and display a small badge next to their name. This increases trust, surfaces authoritative answers, and reduces noise for readers.

#### Inline Anchors & Highlights
Allow users to anchor a comment to a specific section, figure, or page snippet. Threaded replies stay tied to the exact context, improving clarity and making it easier to spot errors or open questions.

### 2. Finance — High friction and cost of accessing trading data

#### Unified Data Connector
One interface that normalizes access across multiple exchanges/APIs into a common schema and time format. Reduces setup time for newcomers and removes glue-code for traders.

#### Query Builder + Cost Estimator
A simple query UI that previews expected rows, latency, and estimated cost before you run it. Prevents surprise bills and helps users choose cheaper data substitutes when possible.

#### Starter Notebooks & Sandbox Datasets
Curated, delayed, or sample datasets plus reproducible notebook templates for common tasks (backtests, factor screens). Lowers the barrier to first results for new investors without expensive feeds.

### 3. Books — Difficult to judge reviews/ratings from anonymous people across many platforms

#### Reviewer Profiles & History
Aggregate a reviewer's past ratings by genre, typical rating range, and notable books. Readers can judge alignment at a glance, improving trust in a given review.

***[!]*** *I found that all ^ these features already exist on LibraryThing and Goodreads, but I decided to keep my thoughts anyway*

#### Cross-Platform Ratings Aggregator
Pull ratings from Goodreads, Amazon, and Google Books into one view with de-duplication and a simple distribution chart. Reveals platform bias and sample-size effects.

#### Taste Alignment Score
Show a personalized "similar-to-you" score for each reviewer based on overlapping ratings and genres. Readers can prioritize opinions from people with similar tastes.
